# Lever Postings API

This repository contains documentation and example apps for the lever postings
REST API. The API is designed to help you make a jobs site. This API is still
quite new and its probably missing some important features. If you need any
features which are missing in this API or find any issues, please email us at
[team@lever.co](mailto:support@lever.co) or file an issue on this repository.

You do not need to use this API to get started with lever job postings. All
published job postings are also automatically viewable via
`jobs.lever.co/yoursite`, for example
[jobs.lever.co/lever](https://jobs.lever.co/lever)

### This API lets you:

- Get paginated job postings for your company
- Get job postings which match particular queries
- Get individual job postings


### The API does not:

- Let you write a custom job posting form, or programatically apply for any of
the postings. If this feature is important to you, please let us know and we
will prioritize it. You should link to `posting.applyUrl` which is at
[jobs.lever.co/site/postingId/apply](https://jobs.lever.co/lever/f6eb3fa6-0ba5-4178-b1ae-e4e0448ba175/apply).
- Let you do full-text searches over open jobs

Note that all jobs posted to lever are currently publically viewable. Supporting internal job postings is on our roadmap but not implemented yet.
