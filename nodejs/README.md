# NodeJS example jobs server

This is an example job posting site written using NodeJS & Express. To run it,
first install [nodejs](http://nodejs.org/) then run `npm install` from this
directory.

I haven't used a templating engine in this example to keep it simple, but if
you want to build from this example, you should definitely pick one and use it.
[Jade](http://jade-lang.com/) is quite popular.
